# FLASH CARDS
## Flash Card Application

## Synopsis
Create a flashcard web app so I don't have to carry around embarassing neon colored notecards on the subway when I want to keep my chops up.
* Fully responsive design
* Made with vanilla js
* Pulls the questions and answers from a JSON file I created using ES6 fetch

## Links

* Live Example - https://robhitt.github.io/flashcards
* Github - https://www.github.com/robhitt/flashcards

## Installation

1. Fire up the [index.html](https://robhitt.github.io/flashcards/) file in any web browser and you'll be good to go!

Note:
* Cross compatiable among all browsers including (Chrome, Firefox, Safari & Opera).
  * However, if viewing in Safari you must view at the live link at https://robhitt.github.io/flashcards otherwise you'll need to "Disable local file restrictions" in the developer's menu as console will throw errors locally.

## Questions
Please send me questions and answers to add to the JSON feed for the application. You can find me anywhere below ⬇️
